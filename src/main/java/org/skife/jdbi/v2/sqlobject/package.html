    <h1>SQL Objects</h1>
    <p>
        The sql objects API allows for declarative definition of interfaces which will handle
        the generation of sql statements and queries on your behalf when needed. Take the following interface:
    </p>
    <code>
        public interface TheBasics
        {
            @SqlUpdate("insert into something (id, name) values (:id, :name)")
            int insert(@BindBean Something something);

            @SqlQuery("select id, name from something where id = :id")
            Something findById(@Bind("id") long id);
        }
    </code>
    <p>
        You obtain an instance of <code>TheBasics</code> via one of three means, the first opens a new
        handle against a DBI instance, the second attaches the object to an already open handle, and the third
        will obtain and release connections on demand against a DBI instance.
    </p>
    <code>
        DBI dbi = new DBI(dataSource);
        Handle handle = dbi.open();

        TheBasics via_open = dbi.open(TheBasics.class);
        TheBasics attached = handle.attach(TheBasics.class);
        TheBasics on_demand = dbi.onDemand(TheBasics.class);
    </code>
